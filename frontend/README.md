# Full Stack Project (M.E.R.N.) – Tavern of Heroes (2025–2026)

Tavern of Heroes is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack, like a gaming forum, where heroes (users) can create accounts, authenticate securely, and share rumors (posts) inside a tavern-style community.

The project includes full authentication with protected routes, user profiles, and ownership-based post management — allowing each user to create, edit, and delete their own content.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of full-stack architecture, API communication, and real-world authentication flows.

Technologies used:
React Router 7, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Zod, JWT, Bcrypt, Jest, Vercel.
